# Contributing to UIStudio

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

Thanks for stopping by and checking out UIStudio.

This project is a personal space where I experiment with UI, animation, and motion design using React and Framer Motion. 

Think of it less as an open-source framework and more like a UI playground â€” a living lab that evolves as I learn and explore.

That said, you're more than welcome to:

- Explore the components
- Take inspiration for your own projects
- Share feedback or ideas

However, I'm currently not accepting external contributions or PRs, as the direction and code structure are tightly connected to my learning flow.

## Getting in Touch

If you have feedback, suggestions, or just want to connect:

## Project Philosophy

UIStudio serves as my exploration ground for:

- Animation patterns and micro-interactions
- Component architecture and design systems
- Performance optimization techniques
- Accessibility best practices
- Modern React development patterns

The codebase reflects my current understanding and experiments, which means it's constantly evolving based on new discoveries and learnings.

## What You Can Do

While I'm not accepting direct contributions, here's how you can engage:

- **Star the repository** if you find something useful
- **Share your projects** that use UIStudio components for inspiration
- **Report bugs** or suggest improvements through GitHub issues
- **Spread the word** if you think others might benefit from the components

Thanks for understanding â€” and feel free to star the repo if you found anything useful ðŸŒŸ
